            The English Civil War
        </h1>
        <p id="ptag1">
            The English Civil War is one of the bloodiest moments in English history, with approximately 1 in 7 people killed. It involved the first overthrowing of a monarch in British history, and arguably started a strand of revolutionary ideas that led to the rise of power of democratic instituitions in Europe.

            The Royalists were one of the sides in the Civil War, led by King Charles I. At the time, tensions were strained by the King and the Parliament. Both sides wanted the majority of power in the country. Thus, as tensions deteriorated further, the two sides went to war. The Royalists were sympathetic to the King. They wore red clothing to distinguish themselves from the Roundheads.

            After many years of oppression by the King, the Roundheads had finally had enough. They planned to overthrow the King and govern England with a new, democratic Parliament. They were led by Oliver Cromwell. The Roundheads were very progressive, as shown by their army, called the New Model Army. This army did not promote people by status or class, but rather by ability, which was a revolutionary concept at the time.
